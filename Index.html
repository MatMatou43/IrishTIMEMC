    <h1>The development of Electric Vehicles in Cantal</h1>
    <p>The expansion of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure is a crucial part of France's plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.
         But it's easier said than done, especially in rural areas where things don’t move as quickly as in cities. 
         A good example of this is Cantal, located in the middle of the Auvergne region.
          In this article, I'll look at how the development of charging stations is progressing in Cantal and how it compares to the growth of the electric vehicle fleet.
           I'll also explore whether this aligns with the ambitious goals set for 2030.

        <h2>The current state of charging infrastructure in Cantal</h2>
       
            <p>
                As of September 2023, Cantal is still lagging behind when it comes to EV charging infrastructure, which is typical of rural areas.
                The region’s low population and remote locations make it a tough place to set up charging stations.
                For example, in the small town of Allanche, there are only two electric vehicles registered, while the total number of vehicles in the area is 848.
                This kind of slow adoption of EVs can be seen across Cantal, where people are not switching to electric as quickly as in other parts of the country.
                </p>

            <p>
                In terms of infrastructure, charging stations are not as widely available as in urban regions. Currently, the region benefits from limited installations, often concentrated in larger towns and on highways connecting more populated areas.

        <h2>Comparing Electric vehicles growth to charging infrastructure</h2>
        <p>One surprising stat is that only 1% of vehicles in Cantal are electric, which is far below the national average.
            For example, in Allanche, EVs make up a very small portion of the vehicle fleet, showing how slow the adoption of electric vehicles is in rural areas.
            </p>

                <p>
                This slow adoption also makes it harder to expand the charging infrastructure.
                 Since there aren’t many EVs in the area, there’s not much motivation for companies or local authorities to invest in new charging stations,
                  which creates a kind of “chicken-and-egg problem.” No one wants to invest in more chargers if there aren’t enough electric cars, 
                  but without chargers, people won’t buy electric cars.
                </p>


        <h2>2030 Targets and future prospects</h2>
        <p>France is aiming for 100,000 public charging stations and 15 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030.
            But getting to these goals will be a huge challenge in areas like Cantal,
            where both the charging infrastructure and EV adoption rates are way behind the national average.
